# neo4j-graph-database-python-integration
This project demonstrates practical integration between a Neo4j graph database and Python. 
The work focuses on:
- Creating relationships between existing nodes
- Executing Cypher queries from Python
- Retrieving and processing graph data
- Implementing and deploying user-defined functions
- Applying regex for structured data extraction
This project highlights backend data interaction and graph-based data modeling.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Neo4j Graph Database
- Cypher Query Language
- py2neo (Python-Neo4j integration)
---
## Key Implementations
### 1. Python–Neo4j Connection
Established connection using Neo4j Python driver to query and manipulate graph data.

### 2. Relationship Creation
Created a `FOLLOWS` relationship between two existing users using Cypher.

### 3. Data Retrieval
Queried and retrieved 100 actor names from the Neo4j movie database.

### 4. Regex-Based Processing
Processed actor names using Python regex to extract Full_Name and last names seprately.

### 5. Custom Neo4j Functions
Designed and deployed user-defined functions to extend database functionality.
